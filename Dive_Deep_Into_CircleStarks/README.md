# {Project Name}

The project is named "Dive Deep into Circle STARKs." Circle STARK is 1.4 times faster than a normal STARK, but the paper is hard to understand, and existing articles that discuss Circle STARK tend to neglect the mathematical details. Moreover, no articles cover the decomposition of the quotient polynomial. Therefore, I wrote a series of articles to explain the mathematical details, covering Sections 3 to 5 of the paper, including the decomposition of the quotient polynomial.

## Team Information

We are SECBIT Labs. We aim to build high-confidence and trustworthy protocol, application, and facilities on the blockchain. We focus on the research of formal verification, practices of zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain security. We have explored the full formal verification for token smart contracts and decentralized exchanges for the first time. We also have designed and implemented the zkPoD, a practical decentralized protocol for data exchange. We reported many buggy smart contracts on Ethereum, including well-known Fomo3D bugs and attack vectors.

## What do you plan to achieve with your project?

I hope my articles can help people who are struggling to understand the Circle STARKs paper.

## Lessons Learned (For Submission)

- What are the most important takeaways from your project?
  - My articles
- Are there any patterns or best practices that you've learned that would be useful for other projects?
  - Math is king, let's learn more math.
- Highlight reusable code patterns, key code snippets, and best practices - what are some of the ‘lego bricks’ you’ve built, and how could someone else best use them?
